__Multi-Agent Customer Support System (Langflow + Agentic AI)__
A multi-agent AI system built with Langflow and OpenAI, designed to handle end-to-end customer support tasks across multiple domains.

This project extends Customer Support Agent into a multi-agent architecture, where specialized AI agents collaborate -  from FAQ retrieval to order 

management - to deliver accurate, context-aware, and automated customer service.

__Overview__

The system leverages Langflow‚Äôs flow-based orchestration to coordinate multiple autonomous agents, each specializing in a different area of support. It combines Retrieval-

Augmented Generation (RAG), Azure AI Search, and agent-to-agent reasoning to provide seamless conversational experiences.

Each agent performs distinct subtasks (retrieval, lookup, summarization, decision-making) and communicates with others through Langflow‚Äôs node connections -  forming an agentic 

support ecosystem.

__Architecture__

| Agent                    | Role                | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FAQ Agent**            | Knowledge retrieval | Answers company FAQs using vector search + OpenAI completions. |
| **Manager Agent**        | Coordinator         | Routes complex requests to specialized agents (product/order). |
| **Order Lookup Agent**   | Data agent          | Queries Azure DB for customer order details.                   |
| **Product Lookup Agent** | Data agent          | Retrieves product specifications or related data.              |
| **Parser**               | Data normalizer     | Converts query results into readable format for LLMs.          |
| **Prompt Template**      | Instruction builder | Standardizes agent prompts with consistent tone and structure. |
| **Chat Output**          | Response handler    | Sends back unified, natural language responses to the user.    |
